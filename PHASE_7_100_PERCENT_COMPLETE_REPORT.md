## **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Real-Time Architecture**
```typescript
// WebSocket Server with Event Management
export class WebSocketServer {
  private connections: Map<string, WebSocket> = new Map();
  private eventManager: RealTimeEventManager;
  
  // Connection management, event routing, error handling
}

// Real-Time Event Manager
export class RealTimeEventManager {
  private subscribers: Map<string, Set<Function>> = new Map();
  
  // Event publishing, subscription management, filtering
}
```

### **Payment Integration**
```typescript
// Stripe Service with Webhook Handling
export class StripeService {
  private stripe: Stripe;
  
  async createSubscription(customerId: string, priceId: string): Promise<Subscription>
  async processWebhook(event: Stripe.Event): Promise<void>
  async handlePaymentSuccess(paymentIntent: Stripe.PaymentIntent): Promise<void>
}
```

### **API Integration Layer**
```typescript
// External API Manager
export class ExternalAPIManager {
  private apis: Map<string, BaseAPI> = new Map();
  
  async fetchMarketData(symbol: string): Promise<MarketData>
  async sendTransactionalEmail(email: EmailData): Promise<void>
  async syncCalendarEvents(userId: string): Promise<CalendarEvent[]>
}
```
