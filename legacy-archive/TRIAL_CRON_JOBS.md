## üìä Database Schema Updates

The following migration has been created to support the trial cron jobs:

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20240321000013_add_trial_notification_tracking.sql`

**Changes**:
- Added notification tracking fields to `trial_users` table:
  - `last_expiring_notification_3` - Tracks 3-day notifications
  - `last_expiring_notification_1` - Tracks 1-day notifications  
  - `last_expiring_notification_0` - Tracks day-of notifications
- Added `archived` status to trial status options
- Added indexes for better performance

## üöÄ Implementation Details

- Fetches all active trials that have passed their end date
- Updates trial status to "expired"
- Updates corresponding subscription status to "expired"
- Sends trial expired email with upgrade and support links
- Handles errors gracefully and continues processing

### Trial Expiring Notifications (`/api/cron/send-trial-expiring-notifications`)
- Fetches trials expiring within the next 3 days
- Calculates days remaining for each trial
- Sends notifications only on specific days (3, 1, and 0 days remaining)
- Uses tracking fields to prevent duplicate notifications
- Sends different email content based on urgency

### Trial Cleanup (`/api/cron/cleanup-trial-records`)

## üìß Email Templates Used

The cron jobs use the following email templates:

- `TrialExpiringSoonEmail` - Sent for expiring notifications

## üîç Monitoring

Each cron job returns detailed statistics:
- Number of records processed
- Number of errors encountered
- Summary of actions taken

Monitor these endpoints in Vercel logs to ensure proper operation.
